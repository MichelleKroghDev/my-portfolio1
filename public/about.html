<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As my children have grown into adults I've decided that I need to do something
  fulfilling and something that will earn money. I've decided to go into front
  end web development because it sounds exciting. I've begun the journey with
  studying it, and also applying what I've learned so far by creating this
  portfolio using html.

  I'm excited to see where my education will take me as i finish up learning
  html, and begin css and javascript. I know that there is of course now so much
  more to learn for front end web development so my learning will not stop with
  these three though.
